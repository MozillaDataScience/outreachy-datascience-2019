This is the main repo used for prospective 2019 Outreachy interns to contribute Mozilla Data Science team projects.

It covers the two 2019 projects:

* [Improve understanding of Firefox growth metrics](https://www.outreachy.org/december-2019-to-march-2020-internship-round/communities/mozilla/improve-understanding-of-firefox-growth-metrics)

The initial contribution process steps are the following:
1. Clone this repo
   - This will download the relevant dataset in [initial_contribution](https://github.com/mozilla-outreachy-datascience/outreachy-datascience-2019/blob/master/initial_contribution/)
2. Read through the [initial_contribution/README.md](https://github.com/mozilla-outreachy-datascience/outreachy-datascience-2019/blob/master/initial_contribution/README.md) file.
