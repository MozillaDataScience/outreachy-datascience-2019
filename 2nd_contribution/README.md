This folder describes the 2nd contribution task. Please complete the tasks in `initial_contribution` before addressing these below. To contribute, please perform the following:

# Tasks
* Utilize the notebook completed in `initial_contribution`
  - Append new work to the bottom of it. 
* Train a regression model predicting `SalePrice` from the other fields in `dataset.csv`
  - A simple model is fine here. We are concerned with the reasoning as to your model choice, not on how well it performs. 
* **Primary Task** - Answer the following questions:  
   - Why did you use the regression model technique you chose? 
   - Why did you choose the predictors/covariates/variables you used?
   - How well does your model perform? Please explain your reasoning and include work regarding model validation. 
     - Do you believe the model overfits or underfits the data?
     - Is there a subset of the data that the model performs better on?

# Submission
* Please submit your final notebook/script by email to one of the mentors, and include which project you are interested in working on ("Improve understanding of Firefox growth metrics" or "Finding Representative Users of Prerelease Firefox")

# Additional Information:
* Visualizations make the world a better place! Use them liberally. 
* Show your code as much as possible.
* Please also explain your code and your thinking process thoroughly and articulately.
* If your model makes assumptions of the data, please show and discuss how valid these assumptions are.
* Write in English as well as in code.
* 3rd party libraries are fine. Just make sure to describe why and how you are using them.
